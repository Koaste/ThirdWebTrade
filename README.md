Thirdwebtrade is a web application aimed to service users with cryptocurrency trading within the ethereum network, as well as making their own token on the rinkeyby test network. The web application uses NEXT JS as it's frontend and solidity as its backend, and sanity as its database.

# ThirdWebTrade Features
Some of it's features include:

- Dashboard that displays top 15 currencies by marketcap 
- Metamask for authentication and authorization 
- Solidity integration for trading between different currencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum

## NEXT JS 

Next JS was used as the frontend javascript framework. The mainpage displays the dashboard displaying various sets of cryptocurrencies and the trading platform between tokens. 

The login function originates from connecting metamask to the application. This was how authentication and authorization of product usage per user's data was validated. No data aside from login confirmation is extracted.

The UI was created with tailwind CSS. 

## Solidity

The backend was created a smart contract and deploying it for the frontend to allow users to trade on what is available from the sanity database.
